### Summary:  ✨  
The goal of the project is to generate valuable insights from the public surveillance videos and store them in a comfortable CSV record dependent on time and frames. The collected insights can be presented in any comfortable way like a dashboard or can be used for analysing data for future developments in the area under surveillance in terms of traffic control, accident prevention, road expansion etc.
### Some generated plots:
we tested our model on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjlBnrzSGjc&ab_channel=Panasonicsecurity) from youtube, here are the inferences:
